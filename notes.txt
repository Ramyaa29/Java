Difference B/W Java and Python

Java:                                                              Python:
 --Compiled                                                     -- Interpreted
 -- Build An Application within 6 months                        -- Build an application within 6 weeks
 -- Runs Faster                                                 -- Develops Faster


 Programming Paradigm:
    it is a conceptualize and structure the implementation of program.

Types of Languages:
Imperative Language - How to Do.  Eg:- JAVA, Python.
Declarative Language -  What to do.  Eg:- SQL.


JAVA is a high level,general-purpose, mermory-safe, object oriented, WORA(Write Once and Run AnyWhere), Portable.

If you want to run a program then class and main method are must.
Public - access modifier
static - no object is required to run
Void- returns nothing
Main- method name (String[] args)

JDK - JAVA Development Kit
        In developer Laptops we use JDK.
        You write Java code using JDK Tools.

JRE - JAVA Runtime Environment.
        In servers we use JRE.
        It is used to run programs
        It is used to compile the programs. (JAVAC).

JVM - Java Virtual Machine.

--> Variable : To store the values
                - To retrieve the Data
                - To perform some operations on data.
                - to store the data.
--> Datatypes:
   There are two types:   1. Primitive Datatype      2. Non- primitive datatype.

   -->Primitive : which are pre-built to store numbers, decimal, characters, symbols, true and false.
                short
                Int
                float
                double
                char
                boolean

   -->Non-Primitive : Either we can use already defined by java as:
                        String
                        Array
                        Class
                        Interface
                        Enum
                      Or built your own datatype like Student, Company etc..
