  Programming Language 
   --> Set of rules/instructions to perform a Task
   --> Languages are built based on Domain.

Difference B/W Java and Python

Java:                                                              Python:
 --Compiled                                                     -- Interpreted
 -- Build An Application within 6 months                        -- Build an application within 6 weeks
 -- Runs Faster                                                 -- Develops Faster


 Programming Paradigm:
    it is a conceptualize and structure the implementation of program.

Types of Languages:
Imperative Language - How to Do.  Eg:- JAVA, Python.
Declarative Language -  What to do.  Eg:- SQL.


JAVA is a high level,general-purpose, mermory-safe, object oriented, WORA(Write Once and Run AnyWhere), Portable.


--> Local Repo - Project in Laptop.
--> Remote Repo - Project in Github.

Installation of JAVA, VSCODE, GITHUB, Git bash.


17th July
If you want to run a program then class and main method are must.
Public - access modifier
static - no object is required to run
Void- returns nothing
Main- method name (String[] args)

JDK - JAVA Development Kit
        In developer Laptops we use JDK.
        You write Java code using JDK Tools.

JRE - JAVA Runtime Environment.
        In servers we use JRE.
        It is used to run programs
        It is used to compile the programs. (JAVAC).

JVM - Java Virtual Machine.
        Convert Byte Code to Binary Code.
        Reads .class file and gives to OS for execution.

18th July 
        --> Variable : To store the values
                        - To retrieve the Data
                        - To perform some operations on data.
                        - to store the data.
        --> Datatypes:
        There are two types:   1. Primitive Datatype      2. Non- primitive datatype.

        -->Primitive : which are pre-built to store numbers, decimal, characters, symbols, true and false.
                        short
                        Int
                        float
                        double
                        char
                        boolean

        -->Non-Primitive : Either we can use already defined by java as:
                                String
                                Array
                                Class
                                Interface
                                Enum
                        Or built your own datatype like Student, Company etc..

21st July

        Type Conversion:
                -> also known as Automatic, implicit, widening
                ->It is done by java compiler, when conversion is done it is considered as safe.
                ->No loss of data[safe].

        Type Casting:
                -> also known as Manual, explicit, narrowing.
                -> It is done by java developer, when casting is done it is considered as unsafe.
                -.loss of data[unsafe].
        
        Number to Number - Compatible type.
        Number to String - non Compatible .

        //Int to String
        String.valueOf(num)
        Integer.toString(num)

        //String to Int
        Integer.parseInt()
        -> It throws an exception called Number format Exception , if we give text as input.
        -> It allows only number within String.
        ->It just adds the number.

        // Int to boolean - not possible.

22nd July
        -> Arithmetic Operators: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus
        -> Relational Operators: ==,!=,<,>,<=,>=.
        -> Logical Operators: &&, ||, !
        -> Assignment Operators : +=,-=, *=, /=
        -> Unary operators : ++,--
        -> Bitwise operators : &,|,^,~,<<,>> 
23rd July
        Control Statements:
        -> In JAVA control statements are used to control the flow of execution of program.

        3 categories:
        -> Decision Making Statements(Conditional) - if, if-else, else if ladder, switch.
        -> Looping Statements (Iterative ) - while, do-while, for
        -> Branching Statements (Jump stmts) - break, continue,return.
